    		<h1 id="wall-sit">Wall Sit</h1>
    		<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>Wall sits are an isometric exercise that strengthens the quadriceps, glutes, and calves. To perform a wallsit, begin with your back against a flat wall and your feet shoulder-width apart slightly in front of you (~2 feet). Slide your back against the wall to induce a bend in your knees, continuing until your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold the position.</p>

    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>It's important to ensure that your knees don't extend past your ankles. This can be controlled by supporting your bodyweight on your heels rather than your toes. If you feel any marked discomfort in your knees, stop the exercise. Anyone with a pre-existing knee condition should discuss with their doctor or physical therapist before attempting wall sits.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="exercise-desc"> 
        	<h1 id="plank">Plank</h1>
        	<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>Planks are an isometric exercise that help produce a strong core, which is vital for proper muscular and skeletal health. To begin a plank, lay face-down on the floor fully extended and use your arms for support. The plank can be done using your palms or elbows to support your upper body. When you're ready to begin the exercise, straigten your legs and engage your core. Ensure that your torso and spine remain straight and that your shoulders stay forwards.</p>

    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>When doing planks, pay special attention to your back and your neck. Keeping your gaze fixed on the floor will help preserve proper neck position, and making sure that your back doesn't arch are vital for properly exercising your core in a plank. The plank can be made less strenuous by supporting your weight with your knees in conjunction with your palms or by performing the plank on an upward incline. Conversely, more challenge can be added by removing support from one of your legs or arms by lifting them in the air.</p>

        <section id="exercise-desc">
        	<h1 id="calf-raise">Calf Raise</h1>
        	<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>Calf raises are a simple exercise that exclusively strengthen your calves. Calf raises can be done with or without held weights depending on how intensely you want to exercise your calves. To do a calf raise, begin with your feet shoulder-width apart and raise your heels from the ground. Once you're on your toes, engage the calf muscles. Slowly lower your heels to the ground, engaging your calves on the way down.</p>

    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>Stretching before calf raises is a good measure to take to avoid injury or cramps. Another way to mitigate injury is to take on a viable rhythym in your exercise and avoid going overboard. Keeping your posture straight ensures that carried weight won't negatively strain the back.</p>

        <section id="exercise-desc">
        	<h1 id="bench">Bench Press</h1>
        	<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>The bench press is a compound exercise that strengthens the chest, triceps, and shoulders in tandem. To perform a bench press, begin by laying face-up on the bench. With your feet flat on the floor, ensure your butt, shoulders, and head are flat against the bench. Don't force a flat back, as maintaining a slight bend is important to maintain correct form. Grip the bar with your arms slightly wider than your shoulders, and, fixing your gaze on the ceiling, lift the bar forward in a linear motion with your elbows extended. Lower the weight to just above your chest at a controlled speed. Once the weight is lowered to your body, begin to lift linearly upwards evenly with both arms. Focus on the sensation of driving your shoulderblades into the bench while lifting upwards. Return to the extended position you began at. When you're done, rack the weight using a linear backwards motion, reverse how you unracked it.</p>
 
    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>It's wise for most people, especially beginners, to lift with a spotter. The spotter will make sure the weight gets racked and doesn't crush the lifter in case of muscle failure. While performing a bench press, ensure that your elbows don't explosively lock up at any point in the motion. As with any weighted exercise, pay attention to your body and understand your limits.</p> 
        </section>

        <section id="exercise-desc">
        	<h1 id="row">Dumbell Row</h1>
        	<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>Dumbell rows are a weighted exercise that targets your shoulders and upper back. This can be done with both arms or one at a time. To perform a double-armed bent dumbell row, bend at your hips to a 45-degree angle, ensuring your back is straight. While bracing your core, lift the weights upwards, avoiding moving your arms past your shoulders. While lifting, keep your arms on a linear upward course, avoiding delineation of the wrists or arms. Lower the weights at a controlled speed, staying bent over until the exercise is complete.</p>

    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>Dumbell rows can be done with both arms, one arm, supported with one knee over a bench, and supported with one arm on a bench. All dumbell rows aim to train the same muscle groups and avoid strain in the back and shoulders. Letting the shoulders or back round out will lead to improper form and potential injury.</p>

        <section id="exercise-desc">
        	<h1 id="deadlift">Deadlift</h1>
        	<h3>Instructions</h3>
    		<p>Deadlifts are a compound weighted exercise that strengthen the hamstrings, quadriceps, glutes, and lower back. The lift also employs upper back, shoulder, and abdominal exertion. To perform a deadlift, begin with the weighted bar on the ground. Squat down and position your shins directly in front of the bar. Grip the bar with an inward facing grip, and focus on keeping your glutes back, back strait, shoulders back, and neck straight with your back. When you begin to lift, focus on lifting the weight with your legs and glutes, and feel the weight transfer through your heels. Be extremely mindful of your lower back and play it safe when you begin to feel pain in that area. Extend your legs to complete the lift, pulling the bar horizontally to your pelvis area. Repeat the inverse motion, ensuring your back avoids strain and your legs carry the weight.</p>

    		<h3>Tips</h3>
    		<p>It's incredibly important to maintain proper form in the back when performing deadlifts. It would be smart to begin deadlifts at a low weight to get the hang of proper form. When lifting, it's also important to ensure that your arms act as nothing more than grips. Exertion of the arm muscles removes from the exercise and has the potential to injure your biceps.</p>
