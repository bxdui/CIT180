    <div class="item col-6 col-m-12"><p class="text">Saxophones, clarinets, and flutes are some of the members of the woodwind family of instruments. Most woodwinds generate sound through use of a reed secured to the instrument's mouthpiece. The reed is vibrated when air is passed through the opening between the reed and the mouthpiece. All woodwinds generate sound using a reed except for the flute, which generates sound through a hole in the headjoint. The headjoint is a length of tube secured to the body which typically has a raised plate and hole for the player to blow through the same way you might make a soda bottle whistle. <div class="text">Sherman Irby, Paquito D'Rivera, and Baqir Abbas are all jazz woodwind players, and although they are each skilled at all three aforementioned instruments, each musician specializes in a single instrument (Sherman Irby saxophpne, Paquito D'Rivera clarinet, Baqir Abbas flute). To the left are selections of each musician performing.</div></p></div>
